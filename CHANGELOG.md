# Changelog

## 2.5.3

* Change building instructions to work with conan 2.0

## 2.5.2

* Add `angular_frequency_t` as type
* Add operators to convert velocity to frequency and vice versa (i.e. velocity / length = frequency)
* Add CodeQL analysis to CI pipeline

## 2.5.1 

* Bugfix: `unit.as<other_unit>()` automatically infers the underlying type if not explicitely specified.
* Using Catch2 test discovery in CMake

## 2.5.0

* Removed implicit conversion from primitives to `unit_t`. See [issue #106](https://github.com/bernedom/SI/issues/106) for details
* When converting units to string a space is inserted between the value and the unit, as described in the [SI brochure, section 5.4.2](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure)
  * > The numerical value always precedes the unit and a space is always used to separate the
unit from the number
* Fix various spelling errors (thanks to [melg8](https://github.com/melg8)). 
* Renamed `sterradiant_t` to `steradian_t`  which is correct
  

## 2.4.1

* Fix reported [issue](https://github.com/bernedom/SI/issues/101) that `operator/(scalar / unit)` would calculate the ratio into the value.
* Add function `as<unit_t>()` to unit for convenient conversion to a unit of the same type but different ratio

## 2.4.0

* Add surface flow and volumetric flow units

## 2.3.0

* Add string conversions for velocity (`m/s`) and acceleration types (`m/s^2`)

## 2.2.0

* Remove deployment to bintray.com as it is scheduled to sunset on May 1 2021

## 2.1.1

* Tests are built without the need for conan if catch2 is found. (using conan is still the preferred way)
* Cleaning up obsolete todos and typos

## 2.1.0

* Moved helper function such as `unit_cast` and `unit_with_common_ratio` to own file for easier maintenance
* Moved cross-unit-operations and `epsEqual` to a separate file for easier maintenance

* Full magnitudes for mass up to zetta_gram

## 2.0.1

* Refactored type dependent functions to use `std::enable_if_v` instead of `std::enable_if::value`
* Use value types for type traits (i.e. `std::is_arithmetic_v` instead of `std::is_arithmetic::value`
* Add `SI::detail::is_ratio_v` and `SI::detail::is_unit_t_v`

## 2.0.0

* Support for fractions as exponents (Types from version 1.x.x are no longer supported)
* Rename access to stored scalar values to `value()` (from previously `raw_value()`) (Brakes interfaces from 1.x.x)
* The conan-package is named `si` instead of `SI` to match the conan naming convention (Include-paths stay upper case)

## 1.7.6

* Refactoring conanfile.py to create cmake object only once for a tiny bit more performance when packing

## 1.7.5

* `conanfile.py` pulls the version out of `CMakeLists.txt` for packaging.
* Selecting the cmake option `SI_INSTALL_LIBRARY=OFF` removes the target `install` completely
* Add new-line to the end of all files to fit with the ConanCenter code convention.

## 1.7.4

* If SI is built from within conan the conanbuildinfo provided by conan will be used instead of getting it from github
* Cleanup of obsolete code

## 1.7.3

* Extended technical documentation
* Add speed of light to velocity

## 1.7.2

* Correct naming for angle types `radian_t` (was `radiant_t`)
* Separate test for version consistency from installation tests

## 1.7.1

* Documentation and tests are only built if built as top-level project

## 1.7.0

* Add literals and typedefs for km/h (`_km_p_h`) m/s (`m_p_s`)
* Add literals for astronomical units of length (AU), light-years (ly) and parsecs (pc)
* API documentation is built over the cmake-target `api_doc`

## 1.6.1

* Add operators `++` and `--` for units
* Add cmake option `SI_ENABLE_TESTING` (default `ON`) to selectively disable tests for SI if used with `add_subdirectory()` and `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`

## 1.6.0

* Implicit type conversion for units (i.e. between units with internal `double` and `float` representation)
* Turn installation of by setting the cmake option `SI_INSTALL_LIBRARY` to `OFF` (default is `ON`). (Thanks to [bladan](https://github.com/bladan) for bringing it up.)
* Acceleration is buildable from v^2 / L (velocity squared divided by length). (Thanks to [bladan](https://github.com/bladan) for the work)

## 1.2.0

* Changed spelling of length unit from 'meter' to 'metre' as this is the official SI spelling according to the [International Bureau of Weights and Measures](https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/)
* added `SI_` prefix to preprocessor flag to disable ratio conversion to `SI_DISABLE_IMPLICIT_RATIO_CONVERSION` to scope it closer
* Renamed template parameters to fit with c++ naming convention ([See this stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/228783/what-are-the-rules-about-using-an-underscore-in-a-c-identifier))
